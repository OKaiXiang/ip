I made use of ChatGPT plus to perform majority of the coding for
the tasks in week 2 and week 3.

Specifically, level-7 and level-8 were made using ChatGPT plus,
and A-MoreOOP was made by ChatGPT.

Besides using it to directly code for me, I also made use of it for
additional information such as debugging, okuke.command instructions for
Git, and understanding how some code and software work.

Every increment since then has been made with extensive help from ChatGPT except Gui.java.
Where ChatGPT truly excels is when I already have a class that has been made that it could refer to.
For example, adding the HelpCommand class was simple and can be done by just showing it a previous
command as an example and specifying what I would like.
