I made use of ChatGPT plus to perform majority of the coding for
the tasks in week 2 and week 3.

Specifically, level-7 and level-8 were made using ChatGPT plus,
and A-MoreOOP was made by ChatGPT.

Besides using it to directly code for me, I also made use of it for
additional information such as debugging, okuke.command instructions for
Git, and understanding how some code and software work.
